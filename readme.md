# lightpainting

## Introduction
This repo contains all interesting lightpainting projects I've tried to create. Currently I'm working on a lightpainting pixel stick which allows me to paint bmp images into a long exposure photo.

## Requirements
### Hardware
* at least an Arduino Uno
* 1.8" TFT with 160*120px resolution
* PS2 Joystick controller
* MicroSD/SD-Card Reader (possibly integrated into the TFT shield)
* WS2812B LED stripes (ideally a string of 160LEDs to fit the same number of pixels on the TFT)
* An USB Powerbank capable of delivering more than 2A
